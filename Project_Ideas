//For this project you are required to build a request forum application, which allows users to create accounts, post their own requests and answer other people's requests. 

Ideas for project:
* Book recommendation/acquiring
* Friend finder
  - in uni trying to find friends
  - system where you submit your degree/units/year and system matches similar together
  - 'request' comes through - 'make a friend'
  - see list of similar people and profiles
  - have separate chats for different degrees/sems/years
* Similar to stack exchange
  - experience points - if people like answer/how many you respond too
  - code/question to ask
  - tag section + search tags
  - accounts
